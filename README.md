# MNIST_HANDWRITTEN_DIGIT_CLASSIFICATION

## Action Plan
- Prepare the data and preprocess it. (Create training, validation, and testing dataset)
- Outline the Model and choose the activation function.
- Set the appropriate advanced optimizers and the loss functions.
- Make the model learn. (Backpropagation)
- Test the accuracy of the model.

## Algorithm
### 1) Import the relevant libraries.

### 2) Preprocess the Data.
- i. Load the dataset
- ii. Extract the training and testing data
- iii. Create a Validation Set (0.1 or 10% of the training data)
- iv. Scale the data
- v. Shuffle the training and validation data
- vi. Batch the Data

### 3) Model Oulining (Feed-Forward NN)
- i. Declare the size for input, output and hidden layers
- ii. Create a Sequential Model with 2 hidden layers
- iii. Optimize the algorithm
- iv. Fit the model on the training data (make the model learn)
- v. Test the model.


#### NOTE:- Model has been tested on Mac M1
